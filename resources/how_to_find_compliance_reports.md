# How to Find PubNub Compliance Reports

PubNub is committed to security and compliance, undergoing various audits and maintaining certifications to meet industry standards. Access to these reports typically depends on your PubNub account type.

## Accessing Compliance Reports via the PubNub Admin Portal

For customers with **Pro accounts** (or higher-tier enterprise plans), compliance reports are generally available for direct download within the PubNub Admin Portal:

1.  **Log in** to your PubNub Admin Portal account.
2.  Navigate to the **"My Account"** section (often a drop-down menu associated with your user profile or account name).
3.  Select the **"Compliance"** option from the menu.
4.  In the Compliance section, you should find a list of available reports for download (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA attestations, ISO 27001 certificates, etc.).

## For Free and Starter Accounts

Users with **Free** and **Starter** PubNub accounts can typically obtain the latest security and compliance reports **upon request**.

*   **How to Request:** Contact PubNub Support by emailing [support@pubnub.com](mailto:support@pubnub.com) or by submitting a support ticket through the PubNub Support Portal. Clearly state which compliance reports or information you require.

## Types of Compliance Reports and Certifications

PubNub often maintains compliance with or attestation for various standards, which may include (but are not limited to, and can change over time):

*   **SOC 2 Type II:** Reports on the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of PubNub's systems.
*   **HIPAA:** PubNub can support HIPAA compliance for healthcare applications, often providing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and details on how its security features (like AES encryption and Access Manager) help meet HIPAA requirements.
*   **GDPR:** Information on how PubNub helps customers meet their General Data Protection Regulation obligations.
*   **ISO 27001:** Certification for information security management systems.
*   **PCI DSS:** While PubNub is not a payment processor, information may be available on how its services can be used in a PCI-compliant manner (e.g., ensuring cardholder data is not transmitted through PubNub or is appropriately encrypted if it must be).

## Important Considerations

*   **Availability May Vary:** The specific list of available reports and certifications can change as PubNub renews them or achieves new ones.
*   **Shared Responsibility:** Compliance in the cloud is often a shared responsibility. PubNub provides a secure and compliant platform, but you are responsible for configuring and using PubNub services correctly within your application to meet your specific compliance obligations.
*   **Contact Support:** If you cannot find a specific report or have questions about PubNub's compliance posture for a particular standard, always reach out to PubNub Support or your account representative for the most current information.
