# How to Write a PubNub App Checklist

The following checklist outlines the steps to create a PubNub-powered application without needing to rely on any third-party services or libraries. This guide is designed for developers who want to build a real-time application using PubNub’s Data Stream Network and their SDKs and custom code where needed.

• PubNub Account Setup and API Key Configuration
  - Create a PubNub account:
    – Go to PubNub’s official website and sign up with a valid email address.
    – Verify your account if prompted, and log in to the PubNub dashboard.
  - Create a new application on PubNub:
    – In the dashboard, navigate to the “Apps” section and create a new app.
    – Provide a descriptive name for your app to easily identify it later.
  - Generate PubNub API keys:
    – From within your newly created app, click on the “Keyset” section.
    – Obtain the publish and subscribe keys for both development and production environments.
    – (Optional) Create multiple keysets for separate environments or microservices.
  - Configure key properties:
    – Assign secure permissions or tokens (using PubNub Access Manager if needed).
    – Enable PubNub features (e.g., Presence, Storage & Playback, Functions) that match your project requirements.
  - Store and manage your keys securely:
    – Do not embed API keys in publicly visible repositories.
    – Use environment variables or secure configuration management to protect your credentials.

• Project Scope Definition
  - Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the PubNub-powered application.
  - Enumerate the specific real-time communication features and functionalities (e.g., messaging, presence, push notifications).
  - Decide on the platforms (web, mobile, desktop) the application will target, using PubNub exclusively.
  - Outline success criteria, performance requirements (e.g., latency, concurrency limits), and key deliverables.

• Technology Stack Selection
  - Confirm PubNub as the sole real-time data stream network provider.
  - Choose programming languages, frameworks, or libraries that integrate well with PubNub (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Swift, Kotlin).
  - Ensure all required functionalities (authentication, backend, etc.) can be built without needing to add extra third-party services.
  - Evaluate PubNub SDK versions for compatibility and up-to-date features.

• User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design
  - Define design guidelines and layout, emphasizing a seamless real-time experience (e.g., chat updates, presence indicators).
  - Outline user flows, focusing on interactions with real-time events (e.g., notifications, live feed updates).
  - Incorporate accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
  - Plan for handling disconnections or offline states gracefully in the UI.

• Data Design
  - Determine if a local or on-device storage solution is needed for caching or offline mode.
  - For persistent data, plan whether you will use PubNub Storage & Playback or another self-hosted solution.
  - Devise naming conventions for channels and handle real-time data streams effectively.
  - Ensure data integrity and performance requirements without introducing additional third-party data services.

• Backend Development
  - Assess whether you need additional server-side logic beyond PubNub’s Data Stream Network and Functions.
  - Utilize PubNub Functions or your own infrastructure to handle custom message manipulation or routing.
  - Define the channels, events, and triggers that orchestrate the app’s workflows.
  - Document any server-side APIs needed (e.g., for user authentication) that rely solely on your own systems or built-in PubNub features.

• Testing
  - Establish unit tests to verify PubNub message payload formats, channel connections, and presence events.
  - Develop integration tests ensuring the UI responds correctly to real-time events (e.g., newly received messages).
  - Use separate PubNub development keysets for staging and production environments.
  - Conduct load testing to evaluate performance under high traffic and concurrency scenarios.

• Deployment
  - Choose your hosting solution for any required server (e.g., self-managed servers, cloud VM).
  - Configure PubNub production keys and environment variables.
  - Define a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process for code updates and fixes.
  - Document build steps or containerization (e.g., Docker) if applicable.

• Security Measures
  - Use PubNub Access Manager (PAM) to control access and permissions for channels.
  - Ensure secure connections with TLS/SSL and consider message encryption if needed.
  - Implement a token-based authentication flow or your own sign-in process without needing external identity providers
  - Apply secure coding practices for any server or client logic to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities.

• Maintenance and Support
  - Monitor PubNub library updates and stay informed on new releases or security patches.
  - Devise an internal logging and analytics approach (e.g., your own tools) to track errors, usage metrics, and performance.
  - Establish a feedback loop for users to report issues and request features.
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation so developers, administrators, and end-users can understand and support the PubNub-powered features.
