I don’t have the “message-actions” documentation content for the PHP SDK. Please paste the source text (or provide a link and the SDK version), and I’ll condense it while preserving:

- All code blocks exactly as-is
- Method signatures, parameters, return types
- Required configuration details
- Error handling, pagination, rate limits (if present)
- Examples

If helpful, you can paste just the “Message Actions” section for PHP (add, remove, list actions), including any notes on permissions/scopes and edge cases.
