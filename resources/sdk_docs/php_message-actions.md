I don’t have the “message-actions” section content to work from. Please paste the PHP PubNub “Message Actions” documentation here (including all code blocks), and I’ll condense it while preserving method signatures, parameters, examples, and essential technical details.

If it’s long, you can send it in multiple parts.
