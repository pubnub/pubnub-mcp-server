# Utility Methods API for C# SDK

The methods on this page are utility methods that don't fit into other categories.

##### Request execution

Use try/catch with the C# SDK. Invalid parameters throw an exception. If the request reaches the server but fails (server error or network issue), error details are in the returned status.

```
1try  
2{  
3    PNResultPNPublishResult> publishResponse = await pubnub.Publish()  
4        .Message("Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#.")  
5        .Channel("my_channel")  
6        .ExecuteAsync();  
7
  
8    PNStatus status = publishResponse.Status;  
9
  
10    Console.WriteLine("Server status code : " + status.StatusCode.ToString());  
11}  
12catch (Exception ex)
