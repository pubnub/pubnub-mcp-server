# How to Implement WebRTC Signaling with PubNub

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data communication directly between web browsers and mobile applications. PubNub plays a crucial role in WebRTC applications as a **signaling service**.

## Understanding PubNub's Role in WebRTC

PubNub is **NOT** a media streaming server for WebRTC. 

*   **Audio/Video Streams are Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** The actual audio and video data in a WebRTC session flows directly between the connected peers, not through PubNub's servers.
*   **PubNub Handles Signaling:** Signaling is the process of coordinating communication. It involves exchanging metadata necessary to establish the P2P connection. This includes:
    *   **Session Control Messages:** Offer, answer, and ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates.
    *   **Error Messages.**
    *   **Call Setup and Teardown:** Initiating, accepting, or rejecting calls.
    *   **Exchanging Media Configuration:** Information about codecs, resolutions, etc.

PubNub's publish/subscribe messaging is perfectly suited for reliably exchanging these signaling messages between peers in real-time.

## Key Components of a WebRTC Setup (Beyond PubNub Signaling)

To build a full WebRTC application, you'll typically need:

1.  **PubNub (for Signaling):** As described above.
2.  **STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) Servers:**
    *   Help peers discover their public IP address and port when they are behind a NAT (Network Address Translator). This is essential for establishing P2P connections.
    *   Google provides public STUN servers (e.g., `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`), or you can host your own.
3.  **TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) Servers:**
    *   Used as a fallback when a direct P2P connection cannot be established (e.g., due to symmetric NATs or restrictive firewalls).
    *   TURN servers relay the media stream between peers, acting as an intermediary. This is not P2P, so it adds latency and consumes server bandwidth.
    *   TURN server hosting requires significant bandwidth and infrastructure. Services like Xirsys, Twilio, or OpenRelay provide TURN server hosting.

## Basic WebRTC Signaling Flow with PubNub

Here's a simplified flow of how two peers (Alice and Bob) might establish a WebRTC call using PubNub for signaling:

1.  **Initialization:** Both Alice and Bob initialize PubNub and subscribe to a signaling channel (e.g., a channel unique to Bob if Alice is calling him, or a pre-arranged channel). They also configure their `RTCPeerConnection` objects with STUN/TURN server details.

2.  **Alice Initiates Call (Offer):**
    *   Alice creates an "offer" (using `createOffer()` on her `RTCPeerConnection`). 

3. 

4.  **Alice Receives Answer:**
    *   Alice receives Bob's answer from PubNub.
    *   Alice sets Bob's answer as her remote description (`setRemoteDescription()`). At this point, both peers have exchanged session descriptions.

5.  **ICE Candidate Exchange:**
    *   As soon as `setLocalDescription` is called by each peer, their browser starts gathering ICE candidates (IP address/port combinations, transport protocols).
    *   When an ICE candidate is available (via the `onicecandidate` event on `RTCPeerConnection`), the peer sends this candidate to the other peer via PubNub.
        ```json
        // Alice/Bob sends to the other via PubNub:
        { "type": "candidate", "candidate": iceCandidateObject, "from": "sender_uuid" }
        ```
    *   When a peer receives an ICE candidate from the other, they add it to their `RTCPeerConnection` using `addIceCandidate()`.

6.  **Connection Established:**
    *   The WebRTC stack uses the exchanged ICE candidates to attempt to establish a direct P2P connection.
    *   Once connected (e.g., `onconnectionstatechange` event shows "connected"), the `ontrack` event fires on `RTCPeerConnection` when media streams from the remote peer are received. These streams can then be attached to HTML `<audio>` or `<video>` elements.

7.  **Call Teardown:**
    *   When a user hangs up, a "bye" message can be sent via PubNub, and `RTCPeerConnection.close()` is called on both ends.

## PubNub Resources and Examples

*   **PubNub WebRTC SDK/Reference Apps:** PubNub has historically provided SDKs or reference applications specifically for WebRTC that simplify this signaling process. Check the PubNub website and GitHub for the latest examples (e.g., search for "PubNub WebRTC JavaScript SDK" or "PubNub WebRTC examples").
*   **Tutorials and Blogs:** PubNub's blog and developer portal often feature tutorials on building WebRTC applications.

## Key Takeaways

*   PubNub is excellent for the real-time signaling layer required by WebRTC.
*   Media (audio/video/data) flows peer-to-peer or via TURN relays, not through PubNub.
*   You will need to configure STUN and (likely) TURN servers separately from PubNub.
*   The signaling logic involves exchanging offer/answer SDPs and ICE candidates over PubNub channels.

Building WebRTC applications can be complex, but PubNub significantly simplifies the critical signaling component.
