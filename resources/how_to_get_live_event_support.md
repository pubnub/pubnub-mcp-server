# How to Get Live Support During Virtual Events with PubNub

PubNub offers options for live support during critical virtual events to help ensure smooth operation when real-time interaction is key. This is especially important for events expecting high concurrency (e.g., over 10,000 concurrent users).

## Inform PubNub About Your Event

**This is a crucial first step:**

*   **Virtual Event Form:** If your event is expected to gather **more than 10,000 concurrent users**, you **must** inform PubNub by filling out the **Virtual Event Form**.
*   **Lead Time:** This form should be submitted at least **10 days before your event** takes place.
*   **Purpose:** Submitting the form generates a support ticket with PubNub. This allows their team to be aware of your event, understand its scale, and coordinate with you beforehand to review your architecture and offer guidance.

To find the Virtual Event Form, you would typically contact PubNub Support or look for relevant links in the PubNub Admin Portal or support documentation.

## Live Support Options

PubNub provides a couple of ways to arrange for live support personnel to be available during your event:

1.  **Platinum Support Plan:**
    *   PubNub's Platinum Support Plan often includes a certain number of hours per month (e.g., 5 hours) dedicated to live event support. These hours typically do not roll over if unused.
    *   **Opt-In:** When you fill out the Virtual Event Form, there will usually be an option to opt-in to use these included support hours for your event.

2.  **Purchased Virtual Events Package:**
    *   If you are not on a Platinum Support Plan or require more dedicated support than your plan includes, you can purchase a **Virtual Events Package** separately.
    *   This package provides dedicated live support resources for the duration of your event.

## How to Arrange for Live Event Support

*   **Contact PubNub Support:** The best way to understand your options and make arrangements is to contact PubNub Support directly at [support@pubnub.com](mailto:support@pubnub.com) or through your account manager if you have one.
*   **Discuss Requirements:** Be prepared to discuss the nature of your event, expected peak concurrency, critical real-time features, and the level of support you anticipate needing.

## Why Live Event Support is Important

For large-scale virtual events, real-time features like chat, Q&A, polling, and live updates are often mission-critical. Live support can provide:
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** PubNub support may be able to proactively monitor key metrics related to your keyset during the event.
*   **Rapid Response:** Quicker access to expert assistance if any unexpected issues arise with the PubNub service or your integration.
*   **Peace of Mind:** Knowing that support is on standby can be invaluable for high-stakes events.

Always plan well in advance for large virtual events. Informing PubNub and arranging for the appropriate level of support are key components of that planning.
